## Flow Control - Challenge

The system receives two parameters via terminal that will represent two integers, with these two numbers you will obtain the number of interactions (for) and print the incremented numbers in the console (System.out.print).

- If you pass the numbers 3 and 10, we will soon have an interaction (for) with 7 occurrences to print the numbers, for example: "Printing the number 1", "Printing the number 2" and so on.

- If the first parameter is GREATER than the second parameter, a custom exception called ParametrosInvalidosException will be thrown with the second message: "The second parameter must be greater than the first".
